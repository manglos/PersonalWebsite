<h1 class="text-primary">2-5 CLASS - LED Team Requirements</h1>
* Agreed that project could be more of a modular LED display system rather than stictly a visor

	Use Case (Chris)
		* User Action - Start application
		* Application Response - Display Message, "Found x LED meshes within range, click to arrange"
		* Application Response - Send â"identity" data to each mesh (e.g. a number or color)
		* Mesh Response - Display 'identity'
		* User Action - Arrange meshes virtually, using the Android application
		* Application Response - Display Message, "Does line appear correctly?"
		* Mesh Response - Display line connecting with each of it's neighbors
		* User Action - Select "Yes" or "No" response
		* Application Reponse - If "Yes", move on to next use case, else repeat from third step.
