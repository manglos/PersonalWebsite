<h2><p class="text-success">Sockets</p></h2>

    A Socket must connect on a PORT
    
    (e.g. http 8080)
    
    When connected on a port, you are a 'client'
    
    On server side, serverSocket ('a socket factory')
        * accept -> socket
                 -> ObjectInputStream
                    (a4 -
                        have mutliple machines open up sockets to each other.
                        they are both servers & clients.
                        MY_PORT = 2689.
                        to emulate 'join' just wait for socket reply.
                        start new sockets, in their own threads.

<h2><p class="text-info">Map-reduce</p></h2>

    Keyed Collections --> Maps
    
    reduce --> take all with same key (e.g. google, reductions are by key on results, form a webpage)
    
    Hadoop (keys sorted) : Google MR (not sorted)
