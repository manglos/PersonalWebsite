<div style="width:600px">My God, what a wonderful year for music!<br />
Some truly great albums were released this year, and some of them by people who I thought were dead!<br />
<br />
Here I will present you with as many of these masterpieces I can find words to say about which don't feel too... too... too... superfluous. (too late)<br />

Arctic Monkeys - AM</h2>

<div>
Here are two questions I asked myself while listening to AM: How had these songs not been written yet? Is this album proof of the Abundance Theory? Surely, if there was any modicum of truth that we live in a world governed by scarcity, this album would either have already been made or worse, never existed. It is as good an album as the Arctic Monkeys have ever made, and they made <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/whatever-people-say-i-am-thats-what-im-not-mw0000703071" target="_blank">this album</a>. The stand-out track for me is <i>No. 1 Party Anthem,</i>&nbsp;which is the best David Bowie song since... since.... since.... well, let's not start trampling over music history with our muddy boots and just say it's as majestic a piece of anything as one could hope for in a post 9/11 world.</div>

Disclosure - Settle</h2>

I would describe <i>Settle</i>&nbsp;as endlessly listenable, one of those albums you wear like a parachute. Emotional dance/electronic music is so hard to get right. It is mostly fodder for one-night-stands, and you thought that about <i>Settle</i>&nbsp;didn't you? But then, two days later, you got a call from him/her and went out for coffee and had a surprisingly fun time in the daylight, under the influence of nothing. Months pass, the dream is still alive, you call your mother and tell her you think you may have found 'the one'. Yes it's true, we all did.</div>

What devil did Ozzie pledge his soul to for his voice to still sound this <i>fucking </i>good? While most of his contemporaries are (wisely) trading their youthful vocal ferocity for more deliberate melodies made of gravel and cigarette smoke, Ozzie is doing both. And it's important that he sounds as good as he does, because the success of most Black Sabbath songs live and die upon Osborne's vocal performances, at least for someone who doesn't inherently love hard-rock like me.

AM &amp; Shawn Lee -&nbsp;<span style="background-color: white; color: #32393d; font-family: 'Whitney 4r', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 24px;">La Musique Numérique</span></h2>
</div>
<div style="text-align: right;">
<a href="http://cps-static.rovicorp.com/3/JPG_500/MI0003/499/MI0003499855.jpg?partner=allrovi.com" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="180" src="http://cps-static.rovicorp.com/3/JPG_500/MI0003/499/MI0003499855.jpg?partner=allrovi.com" width="200" /></a><span style="color: #32393d;"><span style="line-height: 24px;">For those with an eternal soft-spot for synth-pop 2013 was a very good year, and primarily due to AM &amp; Shawn Lee's second album. There are some incredibly delicious bass lines here which are smothered in that special synth sauce and legitimized by myriad&nbsp;ethereal&nbsp;melodies. The brilliance of La Musique Numerique is &nbsp;that each song is really catchy and no song overstays its' welcome. Also, the album does not trail out to oblivion as many synth-pop revivals tend to do, but remains immediate throughout. This is not a serious album for the dark times, though it will add glamour to your happiness.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

<span style="color: #32393d;"><span style="line-height: 24px;">Ghostface Killah - Twelve Reasons To Die</span></span></h2>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://cps-static.rovicorp.com/3/JPG_500/MI0003/506/MI0003506310.jpg?partner=allrovi.com" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://cps-static.rovicorp.com/3/JPG_500/MI0003/506/MI0003506310.jpg?partner=allrovi.com" width="200" /></a></div>
<div>
<span style="color: #32393d;"><span style="line-height: 24px;">What starts as a fairly typical Hardcore Rap album turns at track 5 into something quite peculiar. This is a deeply&nbsp;</span><i style="line-height: 24px;">sad</i><span style="line-height: 24px;">&nbsp;album, far more than&nbsp;melancholic. Ghostface Killah has always been pretty self-reflective for a 'Hardcore' rapper, but Twelve Reasons is by far the most self-reflective album he's made. This is his therapy album, a kin to Beck's </span><i style="line-height: 24px;">Sea Change.</i><span style="line-height: 24px;">&nbsp;He examines his relationships, his lifestyle, the very reasons he is alive. It doesn't hurt that the album is bathed in tremolo guitars, a cinematic choir, and brilliant backing vocal performances. It's an odd record, seemingly pulled out from&nbsp;underneath&nbsp;a sticky seat in an old grindhouse. And you'd be right to wonder, "Where the hell did this <i>thing </i>come from?". Sure, anger is here in force, but also regret and weakness and confusion.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

<div style="text-align: right;">
Silence is the key to Jose James' brilliance. There is so much space for each song to breathe it appears truly effortless. This album also sports some of the most impeccable production values I've ever heard. Every instrument is tuned and mixed perfectly so that a dedicated listen on proper headphones is endlessly pleasing to the ear. James also is a intelligent vocalist; trading masturbatory over-confident riffing for solid melodies performed simply, and with only slight flourishes.</div>
<div style="text-align: right;">
This is rare in a genre overflowing with self-indulgence (as perhaps every genre of music is...), and my respect for Jose James and his latest album only grows.</div>

What a deep pleasure this album is to me, likely since so much obvious pleasure was pre<span style="font-family: inherit;">sent during its' creation. The album is a love letter to the guitar, acoustic and electric. However, producer&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: white;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="line-height: 21px;">Dan Auerbach is clearly a major factor in it's success. Guitar solos are quickly draining to the ear, but Bombino's are far from distracting, they remain the fulcrum of these songs. How do you accomplish this? You employ a wall of sound and let the guitars participate most of the time and only peek over the top every once and again. Vocals don't lead here, they participate and are&nbsp;</span></span><span style="line-height: 21px;">subservient</span><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="line-height: 21px;">&nbsp;to the guitar, another wise move, and let the listener rest&nbsp;comfortably on a firm foundation, letting their mind drift off into the oblivion of endless heat, sand, and mirage.</span></span></span><br />

I believe that growing up, loosing the mysticism of childhood, and observation becoming king over perception are likely candidates. This album is a field you walk through, and like nature, rewards the passive and active consumer in different ways. There is nothing in between us and the music of Majical Cloudz, neither pretense nor production. What realizes the motivation of <i>Impersonator</i>&nbsp;is that all its' elements are singular in focus. Devon Welsh delivers amazing vocal performances one song after the next, and never lifts our suspension. And THAT is what the album does, suspends the listener in a reverie, at first that of the artist, and then (around track 7) our own.&nbsp;</span></div>

<div style="text-align: left;">
<span style="line-height: 21px;">I came across Toro Y Moi last year with his 2nd album, </span><span style="line-height: 21px;"><i>Underneath&nbsp;The Pine, </i>which is really a fantastic chillwave album, successfully being respectful to the (self-proclaimed) seasoned ear and light fun at the same time.&nbsp;<i>Underneath The Pine</i>&nbsp;was one of my favorite albums of 2011, and now <i>Anything In Return</i>&nbsp;is one of my favorites of 2013. Not much has changed since 2011, which is totally fine, this is another great chillwave album, and perhaps you've already heard some of it while driving around in <i>Grand Theft Auto V?&nbsp;</i></span></div>

Just like you can't walk out of the gate with a film like </span><i style="line-height: 21px;">Django Unchained</i><span style="line-height: 21px;">, you couldn't walk onto the music scene with </span><i style="line-height: 21px;">Random Access Memories</i><span style="line-height: 21px;">, it's a self-assured masterpiece which required plenty of resources to make. Perhaps they're the&nbsp;antithesis&nbsp;to George Lucas because Daft Punk have made their finest work to date without the forced&nbsp;discipline&nbsp;of&nbsp;limited resource.&nbsp;</span></div>
