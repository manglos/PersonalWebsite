<p>First of all, thanks for checking out my site! Its' primary purpose is to explain a little about me and showcase my credentials to potential employers, but if you're here for other reasons that's ok too.</p>

<p>
I am a Computer Science major in my Senior year of studies @ Suny Oswego. In May of 2014 I will finish my B.S. in Computer Science and begin my hunt for a Software Engineering position.</p>
<p>I would describe myself as an optimist who has learned to employ pessimism when appropriate in the Software Engineering process. I am self-motivated but prefer to work with others as much as possible. As a programmer, I believe I am in the minority when I say that I greatly enjoy people, especially communicating and working with others on interesting projects. My belief is that a workplace is only as positive as the relationships and interactions that exist there.</p>

<p>As such, my professional goal is to become an integral part of a Software Development team utilizing my knowledge of Software Engineering, Design Patterns, Communication Skills, and many programming languages to their fullest extent.</p> 
<p>I love the outdoors (camping, kayaking, hiking), enjoy music (listening, writing), fancy myself a film-buff, and am a little obsessed with the writings of Kurt Vonnegut. I also smoke a Briarwood Pipe from time to time in a vain effort to become more distinguished.</p>

<p>I have a lovely wife and two beautiful daughters who are my great joy to provide for.</p>
